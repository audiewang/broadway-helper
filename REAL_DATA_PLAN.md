# Real Data Implementation Plan

## Current Issues
1. All data is mock/placeholder - prices don't match reality
2. Dates are hardcoded to July 13-19, 2025
3. No actual connection to Telecharge or other ticket sources
4. Price ranges and availability are completely made up

## What We Need to Build

### 1. Real-Time Data Fetching
We need to fetch actual ticket data. Options:

#### Option A: Direct Web Scraping (Challenging)
- Telecharge uses heavy JavaScript and anti-bot protection
- Would need residential proxies and sophisticated scraping
- Risk of being blocked

#### Option B: Browser Automation Service
- Use a service like Browserless.io or ScrapingBee
- They handle anti-bot measures
- More reliable but costs money

#### Option C: Manual Data Entry + Automation
- Start with manual data collection
- Build tools to help update prices regularly
- Gradually automate what we can

#### Option D: Partner/API Access
- Contact Telecharge/StubHub for API access
- Use affiliate programs that provide data feeds
- Most reliable but requires business relationships

### 2. Accurate Data Structure

```typescript
interface RealShowData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  theater: string;
  telechargeId: string; // Their internal ID
  performances: Performance[];
}

interface Performance {
  date: string;
  time: string;
  availableSections: Section[];
}

interface Section {
  name: string;
  rows: Row[];
}

interface Row {
  rowName: string;
  seats: Seat[];
}

interface Seat {
  seatNumbers: string;
  price: number;
  fees: number;
  available: boolean;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

### 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Remove all mock data**
2. **Build a data collection tool**
   - Manual interface to input real prices
   - Validation to ensure accuracy
3. **Create update mechanism**
   - Regular checks for price changes
   - Alert system for anomalies
4. **Implement caching**
   - Don't hit sources too frequently
   - Store historical data

## Immediate Actions

1. Delete all mock data files
2. Create a simple admin interface for data entry
3. Start with one show (Maybe Happy Ending) and get real data
4. Build from there with accurate information

## Alternative Approach: Link Aggregator

Instead of trying to scrape prices, we could:
1. Be a smart link aggregator
2. Direct users to official sources
3. Provide tips on where to find best prices
4. Track user-reported prices
5. Build a community-driven price database

This would be 100% accurate and avoid scraping issues.
